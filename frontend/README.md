This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Task Views

- All task lists (All Tasks and Project Tasks) support both `List` and `Board` views.
- Use the view toggle in the page header to switch.
- Your selection is saved to `localStorage` (`chronic:taskViewMode`) and applied across pages.
- In Board view, drag tasks between columns to change their status. In All Tasks, dropping into another project's status moves the task to that project.
- Use the `+` button in a column header to create a new task pre-set to that column's status.
 - Completing a task automatically moves it to the `Done` status for its project (or the default `Done` if the task has no project). Setting a taskâ€™s status to a `Done` column also marks it complete.
